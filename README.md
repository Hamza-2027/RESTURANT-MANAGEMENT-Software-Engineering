# RESTURANT-MANAGEMENT-Software-Engineering
1.0. Introduction
1.1. Purpose
	The purpose of a restaurant management system project is to provide a comprehensive solution for managing the day-to-day operations of a restaurant. The system aims to automate and streamline tasks such as ordering, billing, inventory management, and reporting to improve efficiency, accuracy, and customer satisfaction. The overall goal is to increase productivity and profitability while providing a seamless and enjoyable experience for both customers and staff.
1.2. Scope of Project
The scope of a restaurant management system project typically covers the following areas:

1.	Ordering: The ability to take and manage customer orders, including menu customization, order tracking, and table management.

2.	Billing: An efficient and accurate billing system, including integration with payment processing and receipt printing.

3.	Inventory Management: A system for tracking food and beverage inventory, including ordering, receiving, and usage tracking.

4.	Reporting: Generating and analyzing reports related to sales, inventory, and customer data.

5.	User Management: Access control and user management, including secure login credentials and permissions.

6.	Integration: Integration with other systems and devices, such as barcode scanners, receipt printers, and payment processing systems.

The scope of the project may vary depending on the specific needs and requirements of the restaurant, but the above mentioned are the common areas covered in most restaurant management systems.

1.5. Overview of Document
The next chapter, the Overall Description section, of this document gives an overview of the functionality of the product. It describes the informal requirements and is used to establish a context for the technical requirements specification in the next chapter.
The third chapter, Requirements Specification section, of this document is written primarily for the developers and describes in technical terms the details of the functionality of the product. 
Both sections of the document describe the same software product in its entirety, but are intended for different audiences and thus use different language.
 
2.0.	Overall Description
2.1	System Environment

Figure 1 - System Environment

The system environment of a restaurant management system project typically includes the following components:
User Devices: Devices used by customers and staff, such as smartphones and tablets, to interact with the system.
Databases: Databases used to store customer, menu, and transaction data, such as MySQL or MongoDB.
Development Tools: Development tools and environments used to build and maintain the system, such as Visual Studio or c++
The specific components of the system environment will depend on the requirements and constraints of the project, but the above components are typical in most restaurant management system projects.
